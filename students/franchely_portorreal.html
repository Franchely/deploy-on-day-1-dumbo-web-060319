short bio: "Franchely was born in the Dominican Republic and moved to New York City at the age of 2. She loves Radiohead and John Wick. She discovered her interest in coding when she tried creating custom mods for The Sims on her home computer as a teenager. After becoming a hairstylist in the lower east side, she decided it was time to make a change and pursue something she’d always wanted to do but never thought she’d be able to."
